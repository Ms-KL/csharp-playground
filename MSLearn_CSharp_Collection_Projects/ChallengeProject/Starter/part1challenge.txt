    CHALLENGE:

    - update the iteration and selection code to 
        calculate separate final scores for: 
            1) exams
            2) extra credit assignments
            3) overall grade

    - update the code that writes the grading report to the console.

    PART 1: PREPARE
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/challenge-project-arrays-iteration-selection/2-prepare

        Specification
        In this first challenge exercise, you need to: 
            - instantiate the variables that are required for the updated score report, and then 
            - update the Console.WriteLine() statement that writes student grades to the console.

        Your updated application must:
            - use the existing arrays and array values for all student grade calculations.
            - use the nested structure provided by the existing foreach and if statements.
            - declare and initialize any other integer variables that are required for calculating sums.
            - declare and initialize any other decimal variables that are required for calculations and/or score report values.

/*
    The teacher wants: 
        - the updated report to include the {exam score} and 
        - the impact that extra credit work has on the student's final grade. 

        NEW OUTPUT REQUIRED:

        Student         Exam Score      Overall Grade   Extra Credit

        Sophia          92.2            95.88   A       92 (3.68 pts)

/* 
This C# console application is designed to:
- Use arrays to store student names and assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement to iterate through the student names as an outer program loop.
- Use an `if` statement within the outer loop to identify the current student name and access that student's assignment scores.
- Use a `foreach` statement within the outer loop to iterate though the assignment scores array and sum the values.
- Use an algorithm within the outer loop to calculate the average exam score for each student.
- Use an `if-elseif-else` construct within the outer loop to evaluate the average exam score and assign a letter grade automatically.
- Integrate extra credit scores when calculating the student's final score and letter grade as follows:
    - detects extra credit assignments based on the number of elements in the student's scores array.
    - divides the values of extra credit assignments by 10 before adding extra credit scores to the sum of exam scores.
- use the following report format to report student grades: 

    Student         Grade

    Sophia:         92.2    A-
    Andrew:         89.6    B+
    Emma:           85.6    B
    Logan:          91.2    A-
